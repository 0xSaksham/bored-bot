# Bored Bot (made using boredapi)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

This is a simple web page that uses the Bored API to get a random activity suggestion.

The index.html file contains the HTML for the page. It includes a header with the title "Boring Bot", a body with the activity suggestion, and a button to get a new activity.

The index.css file contains the CSS for the page. It sets the background color, font, and button style.

The index.js file contains the JavaScript for the page. It uses the fetch API to get a random activity from the Bored API. The activity is then displayed in the activity element and the title is changed to "HappyBot". The body element is also added to the "fun" class to change the background color.
